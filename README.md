# Colombian-Vehicle-Recognition
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Keras library. Employed for the identification and classification of Colombian vehicle images.

This repository contains a project for Colombian vehicle and license plate recognition using convolutional neural networks implemented in Python and the popular Keras library.

The main objective of this project is to develop a computer vision system capable of automatically identifying the type of vehicles and recognizing Colombian license plates in images or videos. It aims to provide accurate and efficient recognition algorithms specifically designed for the Colombian context.

# Features:

Implementation in Python: The project is developed using the Python programming language, known for its simplicity and flexibility. Python enables easy collaboration and extension of the project.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): The recognition system utilizes convolutional neural networks, a highly effective technique in image processing. Implemented with Keras, the CNN models are trained to detect and classify different vehicle types and recognize Colombian license plates.

Colombian Vehicle Recognition: The CNN models are trained on a dataset containing various Colombian vehicle types, including cars, motorcycles, trucks, and more. The system can accurately identify and classify the type of vehicle in images or videos.

Colombian License Plate Recognition: The recognition system includes algorithms for locating and extracting Colombian license plates from images or videos. By applying advanced image processing techniques, it can accurately recognize the characters and numbers on the license plates.
